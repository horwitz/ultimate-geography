<b>Ultimate Geography ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ v0.1</b> features:

- Canada's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"><b>10 provinces and 3 territories</b></a> (52 cards)
- with <b>flags</b> and <b>maps</b> for each.

To help with memorisation and provide context while learning, some notes include extra information&mdash;specifically, similar flags.

You can use Anki's <a href="https://github.com/anki-geo/ultimate-geography#custom-study">filtered deck feature</a> to focus your study on a subset of the deck, such as just territories or just a single note template (e.g. map to countryâ€ ).
